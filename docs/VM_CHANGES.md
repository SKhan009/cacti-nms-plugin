# VM configuration changes

## 2026-08-31 — Traffic automation `ifIP` warning

Device 2 does not return the `ifIP` field for the **SNMP - Interface Statistics**
data query. The unsupported `ifIP is not empty` condition was removed from these
enabled rules:

- Traffic 64 bit Server
- Traffic 64 bit Server Linux

The useful `ifOperStatus is Up` and `ifHwAddr is not empty` checks remain. Cacti's
automation command was run for Device 2 after the change and completed without the
previous warning.

The original database rows are backed up in the VM at:

`/home/cactiadmin/nms-deploy/automation-ifip-before.sql`

This is a Cacti database configuration correction; no Cacti core file was changed.
